Pelican Site - Demo
# Git branch for my pelican static site experiment. 

More to come but the gist is the following.    

Python running in a virtual env. pelican and markdown installed.  The server currently is a linux box running nginx and serving a plainly static website. 

I hacked a free html5 template from here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/ 

Significant changes were made to say the least. 

Still very much a work in progress.
