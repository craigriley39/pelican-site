<p>I figure that the more software you have running the more you have to worrry about.  To that end I decided I would take a slightly different approach with the whole blogging thing for that reason and a couple more. </p>
<p>Here are some things that I considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is going to read the thing?</li>
<li>How do you like to write? and do you care about collaboration?</li>
<li>What do you really need it to do?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other questions but for me those three were the ones that stuck out.<br />
1. Who is going to read the thing? - A. In all liklihood, me.  There are tons of things and notes and items that I have collected in one form or another that I keep coming back to. Maybe I work on a piece of technology and then dont revisit it for a really long time. All the tips and tricks and things and such that I've picked up leave my head and its good to ahve someplace that I can go to remember. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do you like to write? and do you care about collaboration? A. For me, I like to write quick and simple notes in Vi. I have been using that editor for many, many years and its just something that I'm very familar with.  And no...I am not interested in collaboarting this is just for me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you really need it to do? A. Well, not much! I really dont need a blog to do much at all. Store pages, Orgnaize things into topics and themes and allow me to search throgh them fairly quickly. That's pretty much it. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The other thing that I worry about is security. I setup a default wordpress site once and was amazed at how many bogus comments I ended up getting. The longer I leeft the site up with the default config the more I would get. Hundreds of completely bogus comments. I have no idea why.  Now Wordpress does a fairly good job with security but running it in production elsewhere it was clear to see that the more functionality you have the more you have to exploit . Simplier is better if simple is all you need! </p>
<p>So that's what's up with this project.  I figured I would go with a static blog and if I wnated to do something more elaborate in the future I could move this to github for future refernce.  </p>
<p>So there you have it...a completely static web blog created using pelican. Simple Linux box, Nginx serving a static directory on a local file system and a site created using css/js and html5 templates.  Simple :-)</p>
