Summary: A guide to securing your infrastructure


There really is no guide to securing your infrastructure - its pretty much impossible.  I applaud your efforts though!


There are no "simple fixes" and surly no simple how-to template that you can follow.

While this may be the most secure computing model, I think it's safe to say that you lose a bit of functinality with the above approach! 

The truth of the matter is for a computer system to be worthwhile it must be useful, and to be useful it almost always has to be interconnected to some other computer system and it always needs to be on.  The other key attribute to a useful computer system is it needs to be avaiable so that it can be used by humans.  And humans are the real problem.  As time tics on we become more and more trusting and dependant on all the gadgets and with each and every one of them there are risks.

It isn't just our need to be connected that makes us vulnernable, its our desire to be connected as easily and quickly as possible without understanding how we are connected in the first place that makes us vulnerable.  I think that in this day in age our largetst defense against the dark arts of the cefisticated computer hacker is the fact that the computer hacker largely doesnt really give a crap.  Your best defense is not being a big target. From a security stand point that really isn't the best approach in the whole world when it comes to preparing for the next attack.
