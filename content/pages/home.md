#Random pages of things I can't seem to remember




Welcome to my site. I've collected a bunch of old notes and things that I've gathered over the years. Some of the scripts and programs and such have not been used in so long I couldn't tell you if they actually work. My job has changed considerably over the years and i'm not longer a UNIX dude :( . My focus these days is more around security and leadership but its still fun to recall where it all began.  If you stumbled upon this site then frankly i'm a bit surprised...but if you did then feel free to take a look around...hopefully there is something here you find useful.
